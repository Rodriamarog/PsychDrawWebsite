# Performance Optimization Strategies for PsychDraw

## Overview

Achieving high performance requires optimizing various aspects of the application, from the frontend rendering to backend interactions and external API calls. This document outlines key strategies to ensure the PsychDraw app is fast and responsive.

## 1. Frontend Optimization (Vite + React)

-   **Code Splitting:**
    -   Use dynamic `import()` and `React.Lazy` to load components/pages only when needed.
    -   Reduces initial JavaScript bundle size, leading to faster initial page loads.
-   **Component Memoization:**
    -   Wrap components that render often with unchanged props in `React.memo`.
    -   Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` to prevent expensive calculations or function recreations on every render.
-   **Efficient State Management:**
    -   Minimize the scope of state updates to prevent large parts of the UI from re-rendering unnecessarily.
    -   Consider libraries like Zustand or Jotai for complex global state if needed beyond the MVP, potentially offering more granular updates than Context API.
-   **List Virtualization:**
    -   For potentially long lists (clients, analysis history), use libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtualized`.
    -   Renders only visible list items, drastically improving performance for large datasets.
-   **Image Optimization:**
    -   Serve images (logos, avatars, drawings) in optimized formats (e.g., WebP).
    -   Resize images appropriately for their display context (thumbnails vs. full view).
    -   Lazy-load images that are initially off-screen.
-   **Bundle Analysis:**
    -   Use tools like `vite-plugin-visualizer` periodically to inspect the production bundle.
    -   Identify large dependencies or code chunks that could be optimized or code-split further.
-   **Debouncing/Throttling:**
    -   Apply to user inputs that trigger frequent actions (e.g., search filters) to limit execution frequency.

## 2. Backend Optimization (Supabase - Database & Storage)

-   **Database Query Performance:**
    -   **Indexing:** Ensure appropriate database indexes exist for common query patterns (already partially addressed in schema). Analyze slow queries using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.
    -   **Pagination:** Implement server-side pagination (`limit`/`offset` or cursor-based) for all potentially large lists (clients, analyses) in Supabase queries. **CRITICAL**.
    -   **Selective Columns:** Only `select()` the necessary data columns for each query. Avoid `select('*')`.
-   **Storage Optimization:**
    -   **Image Pre-processing (Backend/Edge Function):** Consider resizing/compressing drawing images *before* final storage or AI analysis to save storage and reduce load/analysis times.
    -   **Efficient Access:** Use Supabase Storage APIs effectively (e.g., generating signed URLs).
-   **Edge Functions:** Optimize code within any Supabase Edge Functions for efficiency and minimal cold starts.

## 3. AI Analysis Optimization (Gemini API)

-   **Asynchronous Processing (CRITICAL):**
    -   Never block the UI waiting for AI analysis.
    -   Implement an async flow: Upload -> Trigger Analysis (e.g., via Edge Function) -> Show Processing State -> Notify User on Completion (e.g., Realtime Subscription).
-   **Image Pre-processing (Client-side):**
    -   Resize/compress images *before* uploading to the minimum dimensions/quality required by the Gemini Vision model. This drastically reduces upload time.
-   **Payload Minimization:** Send only the essential data (processed image) to the analysis endpoint.
-   **API Model Choice:** Evaluate different Gemini models (e.g., Pro vs. Flash) for the best speed/quality/cost trade-off for the analysis task.

## 4. Network & General

-   **CDN:** Leverage CDNs provided by the frontend hosting platform (e.g., Vercel) and Supabase Storage.
-   **Caching:** Utilize browser caching for static assets. Consider appropriate caching strategies for fetched API data (e.g., client list).

## Prioritization

For the biggest initial impact, focus on:
1.  Asynchronous AI Analysis Flow.
2.  Database Pagination.
3.  Image Optimization (Client-side pre-processing & serving optimized formats).
4.  Frontend Code Splitting.

Continuous monitoring using browser developer tools and backend analytics is essential to identify and address performance bottlenecks as the application evolves.
